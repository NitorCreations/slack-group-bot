# Slack bot project

## Plan for bot interface

### Using commands

- Add to group: /groups join [group_name]
- Remove from group: /groups leave [group_name]

## Git practices

- Git commit naming convention: https://cbea.ms/git-commit/
- Name branches by feature name
- New features are developed in their own branch
- New features are merged into main branch through pull requests
- Pull requests require someone to verify the code and make sure it passes linter and tests

## Linter

-SonarLint (eclipse) (default settings)
